			"description": "Hello a Sins noob speaking. I have quite some experience in strategy gaming, and have read quite some posts on how to improve in this game, and thats where i found out about a strategy that focuses around rushing a titan. My faction of choice is advent rebel, and i heard that their titan is one of the scariest if used correctly, but i rarely even build it let alone even level it. The only situation i have ever built a titan was to deal a final blow to the enemy, who was already crushed, but that was about 1,5 h into the game. Can someone please explain if it is even possible to rush a titan in a normal game, and how to do it. I would be greatful if you could help me. "
